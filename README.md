# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds with specific color combinations and the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility.  The issue involves unexpected visual results, such as color banding or incorrect gradient transitions.

## Bug Description

The provided HTML uses a gradient background with `bg-gradient-to-r` from blue to purple.  In some environments, this gradient may render unexpectedly. The gradient may exhibit banding, or the colors may not transition smoothly.

## Solution

A possible solution is to specify more precise color values, use a different gradient direction or consider alternative approaches like linear-gradient in CSS to have more control.
